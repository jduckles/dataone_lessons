# Welcome to the DataONE Data Management Education Module Repo!

This repository contains DataONE Education modules that are currently being translated from Powerpoint format to a more easily updated, markdown format.

## Guidelines for presenters

### Where to find the material?

A list of the lessons can be found on [the website associated][website] to this
repository. The first page will present you with a list of the ten lessons, and
clicking on each lesson will launch the presentations.

### How does this work?

The slides are provided as html documents that you can view and present in your
browser. Everything should work out of the box in reasonably recent versions of
Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Please note that your browser needs to allow
javascript.

### Presentation mode

Every slide deck can be cloned by pressing `c`. This will open it in another
pop-up window. Your browser may prompt you to allow or reject this pop-up
window. One the two windows can go on your presenter screen (press `p` to
activate presenter mode), and the other will go on the screen for your audience
(press `f` for fullscreen).

You can change slides by pressing the left and right arrows, or by swiping left
or right on a touch-enabled device.
