# The Data Lifecycle

Several stages require critical attention to ensure effective data sharing

| Step         | Action                                                        |
|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Describe** | document the data content, character and process              |
| **Deposit**  | store the data in a location from which it can be accessed    |
| **Preserve** | select storage formats and media with long term use in mind   |
| **Discover** | publish information about the data so that others can find it |

???

Effective data sharing requires careful thought during each stage of the data development process including:

* description and documentation of the data process, content, and character;
* deposition and storage of the data in a location from which it can be accessed or shared;
* preservation of the data using a format and media that enable long term reuse; and
* making the data discoverable by publishing information about the data in research publications, data clearinghouses and data distribution portals.


---

# Why share data

.two-third[
Data sharing requires effort, resources, and faith in others. Why do it?

For the benefit of:

* the public
* the research sponsor
* the research community
* the researcher
]
.one-third[

???

Why expend the extra effort to share data? Because it benefits the public, the research sponsor, the research community and, perhaps most importantly, the researcher.

---

# Value of Data Sharing: **To the Public**

.two-third[
A better informed public yields better decision making with regard to:

* Environmental and economic planning
* Federal, state, and local policies
* social choices such as use of tax dollars and education options
* personal lifestyle and health such as nutrition and recreation
]

.one-third[ ![](images/image7.jpeg) ]

???

How does the public benefit from shared research?
The more informed the public the better they are able to understand and contribute toward effective public and personal decisions:

* environmental and economic planning
* federal, state and local policies
* social choices such as voting, use of tax dollars and education options
* personal lifestyles and health choices such as exercise, smoking, and nutrition

# Value of Data Sharing: **To Researcher Sponsor**

* Organizations that sponsor research must maximize the value of research dollars
* Data sharing enhances the value of research investments by enabling:
  * verification of performance metrics and outcomes
  * new research and increased return on investment
  * advancement of the science
  * reduced data duplication expenditures
  * enhancing and extending the record of science

???

Why do research sponsors encourage data sharing? Because sponsors have an obligation to maximize the investment of research dollars.

Data sharing enhances the value of the research investment by enabling external reviewers to verify the project performance metrics and outcomes. This not only increases the credibility of the data but also spurs new research that can build upon the initial investment and advance the science rather than duplicate expenditures.

# Value of Data Sharing: **To Scientific Community**


.two-third[
Access to related research enables community members to:
* build upon the work of others and further, rather than repeat, the science4
* perform meta analyses that cannot be performed with individual datasets or laboratories
* share resources and perspectives so that comprehension is expanded and enhanced]

.one-third[

]


???

The scientific community as a whole also benefits from sharing among researchers. Data sharing allows researchers to build upon one another's work and to further, rather than duplicate, the science by exploring new findings or combining findings into meta analyses that cannot be performed with individual data. In sharing data, the scientific community expands both individual perspectives and the collective comprehension.

# Value of Data Sharing: **To Scientific Community**

Access to related research enables community members to (cont’d):

* increase transparency, reproducibility and comparability of results
* expand methodology assessment, recommendations and improvement
* educate new researchers as to the most current and significant findings

???

Access to related research enables members of the scientific community to better reproduce, compare and assess methods and results. Scientists are able to learn from one another and educate new researchers as to the most current and significant findings.

# Value of Data Sharing: **To the Scientist**

.two-third[
Scientists that share data gain the benefit of:

* research sponsor recognition as an authoritative source and wise investment
* improved data quality due to expanded use, field checks, and feedback
* greater opportunity for data exchange
* improved connections to scientific network, peers, and potential collaborators
]

.one-third[

???

And finally, how does the independent researcher benefit from data sharing? When scientists share their data, they gain recognition as an authoritative source and respect as a wise investment for research dollars. When data are exposed, feedback from the broader community can be used to improve the quality and presentation of the data. Shared data also allows for greater opportunity for data exchange and networking opportunities with peers and potential collaborators.

# Concerns About Data Sharing

Even if the value of data sharing is recognized, concerns remain as to the impacts of increased data exposure.

# Concerns About Data Sharing

| Problem                                                                     | Solution |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------|
| inappropriate use due to misunderstanding of research purpose or parameters | **?**    |
| security and confidentiality of sensitive data                              | **?**    |
| lack of acknowledgement / credit                                            | **?**    |
| loss of advantage when competing for research dollars                       | **?**    |

???

Researchers may worry that the data will be taken out of context, misinterpreted or used inappropriately. They may also be concerned about maintaining the confidentiality and security of sensitive data. Business concerns may arise as well. Will data users give proper credit and acknowledgement to the scientist? Will the scientist lose a competitive advantage by sharing this valuable resource?

# Making Data Sharable

**Step One:**

* Create robust metadata that is discoverable
* specify geography and time periods
* use discipline specific theme, place and temporal keywords, thesauri, and ontologies
* describe attributes
* include links to associated data catalogues, data downloads, project websites, etc.

???

The more robust your metadata, the easier your data will be discovered and the more appropriately it will be applied. Making data sharable involves the following steps.

Step 1: Create robust metadata that will be discoverable.  Be specific in regards to geography and time periods. Use discipline specific themes, place names, and keywords.  Describe any attributes and include links to associated data catalogues, data downloads, and project websites.


---

# Making Data Sharable

**Step Two:**

Include archival and reference information

* properly formatted data citations for the data and all sources
* Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID) that uniquely identify your data and help to link the data with the metadata See the DataONE unique identifier guidance at: http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/design/PIDs.html

**Data Citation Example**: Sidlauskas, B. 2007. Data from: Testing for unequal rates of morphological diversification in the absence of a detailed phylogeny: a case study from characiform fishes. Dryad Digital Repository. doi:10.5061/dryad.20


???

Step 2: Be sure to include archival and reference information with properly formatted data citations for sources and content. Include persistent data identifiers and any related metadata identifiers.

# Make Data Sharable

**Step Three:**

Have data contributors review your metadata to ensure validity and organizational ‘correctness’?

* are the processes described accurately?
* are all contributions adequately identified?
* has management reviewed the product and documentation?
* is the funding organization properly recognized?

???

Step 3: Be sure to have data contributors review their metadata to ensure validity and organizational correctness.  Are the processes correct? Is your contribution adequately represented and reflected? Is your organization properly recognized and is the funding organization properly recognized? Be sure to get management and sponsor approval on the data publication including the content, presentation, and manner in which contributors are identified.


---

# Make Data Sharable

**Step Four:**

## Publish your metadata and/or data via:

### e.g. Federal Data Catalogs
    * data.gov
### e.g. Data Repositories
* Knowledge Network for Biodiversity (KNB) Data Portal
* Long Term Ecological  Research (LTER) Network Data Portal
* Institutional data repositories
### e.g. Other Online Resources
* Project and/or Program websites
* Web-accessible folders (WAF)
* Community or Public Cloud

Searchable directory of repositories for publishing your data
* http://service.re3data.org/search

???

Step 4: Publish your metadata in data portals and clearinghouses.  Seek out relevant government portals and portals developed by specific communities of practice.

---

# Make Data Sharable

## Step Four

### Publish your metadata and/or data via: (cont’d)

#### Other Online Resources:

* Project and/or Program websites
* Links within online lessons and outreach products
* Web-accessible folders (WAF)
* Community or Public Cloud

???

In addition to Data Clearinghouses and portals, consider publishing your metadata at project or program websites that describe program activities. You can place links within online lessons, outreach products, and into training related resources. For example one can publish their metadata to a WAF, or Web-Accessible folder, that enables direct search and discovery without going through a portal or clearinghouse application. Community or Public Clouds are similar to WAFs. Public and communal clouds offer generous bandwidths and a shared storage system which provides an effective method for data sharing.

# Best Practices

* Document and publish data using standards
* Promote data use via presentations and meetings
* Solicit feedback from data users and address identified issues
* Monitor publications and websites for data use and address misapplications

???


Data Sharing ethics require researchers to follow some basic best practices.
 
First, make sure your data is available by documenting and publishing your data using standard formats and protocols.

Second, promote data use via presentations and meetings and make others aware of your data and findings. Third, solicit and be open to feedback from data users and address identified issues to improve your data.  Lastly, monitor publications and websites for data use and address any misapplications found.

# Data in Real Life

* In 2003, a group of scientists from the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug  Administration, drug and medical imaging industries, universities, and nonprofit groups joined in a collaborative effort to find the biological markers  that show the progression of Alzheimer’s disease in the human brain.
* The goal of this project was to do research on a massive scale that would involve sharing and making accessible all the data uncovered to anyone in the world with a computer.
* Dr. John Trojanowski an Alzheimer’s researcher at the University of Pennsylvania stated,  “It’s not science the way most of us have practiced it in our careers. But we all realized that we would never get biomarkers unless all of us parked our egos and intellectual-property noses outside the door and
agreed that all of our data would be made public immediately.”

# Summary

* Data sharing adds value to the data
* It is the responsibility of the researcher to share their data
* Metadata supports data accountability, liability, and usability
* Sponsors expect, some require, data to be shared
* Data sharing is essential to the advancement of science

???

In summary, data sharing adds value to the data. As such, it is the responsibility of the researcher to share their data. Metadata should be created for data resources to support data accountability, liability and usability. Research sponsors expect, and increasingly require, data to be shared.
